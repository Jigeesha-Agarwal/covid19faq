        "question": "What should I do if I get sick or someone in my house gets sick?",
        "answer": "Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. CDC has directions for people who are recovering at home and their caregivers, including: Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. If you have COVID-19, tell your close contacts so that they can quarantine at home and get tested. Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. Everyone else should wear masks at home. Masks offer some protection to the wearer and are also meant to protect those around the wearer, in case they are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.​ Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person. However, some people may need emergency medical attention."

        "question": "What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has Covid-19?",
        "answer": "The best way to protect yourself and others is to quarantine by staying home for 14 days if you think you’ve been exposed to someone who has COVID-19. Check your local health department’s website for information about options in your area to possibly shorten this quarantine period. If possible, stay away from others, especially people who are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. You may NOT need to quarantine if: You have been fully vaccinated and have no symptoms or you were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last three months and don’t develop any new symptoms."
