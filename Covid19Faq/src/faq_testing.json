        "answer": "Yes. At-home testing and collection allow you to collect a specimen at home and either send it to a testing facility or preform the test at home.

        "question": "Should I be tested for a current infection?",
        "answer": "The following should be tested for current infection: People who have symptoms of COVID-19. Most people who have had close contact (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with someone with confirmed COVID-19. Fully vaccinated people with no COVID-19 symptoms do not need to be tested following an exposure to someone with COVID-19. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 within the past 3 months and recovered do not need to get tested following an exposure as long as they do not develop new symptoms. People who have taken part in activities that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 because they cannot physically distance as needed to avoid exposure such as travel, attending large social or mass gatherings, or being in crowded or poorly-ventilated indoor settings. People who have been asked or referred to get tested by their healthcare provider, or state, tribal, localexternal icon, or territorial health department. CDC recommends that anyone with any signs or symptoms of COVID-19 get tested, regardless of vaccination status or prior infection.  If you get tested because you have symptoms or were potentially exposed to the virus, you should stay away from others pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional."

        "question": "How can I get tested for a current infection (viral test) and what does my test mean?",
        "answer": "A viral test checks specimens from your nose or your mouth  to find out if you are currently infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Contact your healthcare provider or visit your state, tribal, local, and territorial health department’s website to find the latest local information on testing. The type of viral COVID-19 tests offered differ by location. You and your healthcare provider might also consider either an at-home collection kit or an at-home test if you have signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and if you are not able to be tested by a healthcare provider or public health official. While waiting for test results pdf icon[2 pages, 224KB], you should self-quarantine at home and stay away from others, including those living in your household. If your test results are positive, isolate yourself. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19 and are not tested, it is still important to stay home.

        "question": "How can I get tested for a past infection (antibody test) and what does my test mean?",
        "answer": "Antibody tests for COVID-19 are available through healthcare providers and laboratories. Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests and whether you should get one. A positive test result shows you might have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses (called coronaviruses), such as the one that causes the common cold. Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide some protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last. Confirmed and suspected cases of reinfection have been reported, but remain rare. You should continue to protect yourself and others since you could get infected with the virus again. If you test negative, you might not have ever had COVID-19. Talk with your healthcare provider about your test result and the type of test you took to understand what your result means. Regardless of whether you test positive or negative, the results do not confirm whether or not you are able to spread the virus that causes COVID-19. Until we know more, continue to take steps to protect yourself and others."

        "question": "Can someone test negative and later test positive on a viral test for Covid-19?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is possible. You may test negative if the sample was collected early in your infection and test positive later during this illness. You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and get infected then. Even if you test negative, you still should take steps to protect yourself and others."
