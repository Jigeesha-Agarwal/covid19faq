You will need an OTP verification prior to registration and a confirmation slip/token will be generated after registration. You will also get a confirmatory sms later.

For Government hospitals, a proportion of slots will be available for online registration and appointment, the rest will be kept for on site registration and vaccination. Appointments for any date for a Vaccination Center will be closed at 12:00 pm on the day prior to the date."
